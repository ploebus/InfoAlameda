		        <p>For example, let's say you want to find the census tracts in Alameda that have mortality rates greater than 800 mortalities per 100,000 people. You would double click 'All-Cause Mortality Rate 2006 - 2008'. Then you would click the greater than button from the calculator. Finally, you would click in the dialog box and write in 800.</p>
